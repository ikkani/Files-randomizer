# Files-randomizer
FilesRandomizer.py is a simple program made to rename the files of a choosen folder randomly. Furthermore, the user can choose the destination folder and both a prefix and a suffix common in all the randomized files via a GUI.

One possible use of this program could be randomize a set of music files in order to mix it randomly in old music devices that may not have a "random music playlist" function built-in.
